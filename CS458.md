# Blockchain Overview – [2 - 3 questions]

## Notes
- A blockchain provides coordination between many parties when there is no single trusted party.
- If trusted party exists there is no need for a blockcahin
- Blockchains can be used in other areas as well like digital asst management.
- Ledgers record all business activity as transactions
- Every market and network defines a ledger
- Ledger records assest transfers between participants
- Problems with traditional ledgers:
    - Too many ledgers
    - Errors in data recording
    - Diverging Ledgers
    - Centralized control - Single point of failure
- Decnetralized distributed ledger records all business activity as transactions
- Shared and replicated in multiple sites
- Controlled by multiple untrusted participants
- Records are added only after reaching consensus
- Problems with blockchain:
    - Double spending 
    - Denial of Service
    - Forking
- A blockchain is a distributed data strucutre that takes the form of an immutable, append-only ledger, maintained by a network of peers rather than a central authority, and that uses cryptography and consensus to ensure consistency.
- Dissimilar to a database that uses "CRUD" Principle
    - Create
    - Read
    - <span style="color:red">Update</span>
    - <span style="color:red">Delete</span>
- Blockchain has only"
    - Create
    - Read
- Records are permanent
- Immutability: Blockchain entries are difficult to alter once they are included in a block. It has has to be achieved by replication.
- Blockcahin: A distributed ledger
    - Eliminates need for central clear house or arbiter
    - Instead, there are multiple mutually distrusting arbiters
    - Multiple copies of distributed ledger can help against ransomware.
- Why is blockchain exciting?
    - Digital currencies that are accessible to anyone connected toi hte internet
    - Decentralized applications
    - Writing decentralized programs
    - Can revolutionize more than just currency
- How does it work?
    - Information is stored in blocks. Each block includes a timestamp, a link to a previous block, and is crypto locked with a hash to prove the contents have not changed.
- Blockchain fundamentals:
    - Add new transactions and organize them into blocks
    - Cryptographically verify each transaction in the block.
    - Append the new block to the end of the existing immutable blockchain
- Proving you authorized to enter a transaction
    - Step 1: to be a participant
        - you must have cryptographic key pairs.
    - Step 2:
        Digitally sign the data
    - Step 3: Block miners finally add and lock the new block
        - Each block verifies the integrity of all blocks in front of it
        - Miner: a computer that creates blocks of transactions and adds blocks. the process is called mining.
- What can go into a blockchain?
    - Transactions
        - virtual currency, securities
        - property transfers
    - Data
        - Intellectual property, songs, poems, art
        - documents
    - Smart Contracts -- executable code
- How are blocks added to the chain?
    - A user signs their list of tranactions
    - A miner then finds a vlaue that makes the hash work
    - After this the new block is broadcast
    - Other miners verify the block and add it to their chain if valid
    - Majoirty of miners need to validate
- Blockchain security properties:
    - Immutability:
        - Blockchain entries are difficult to alter once they are included in a block.
    - Non-repudiation:
        - Entities cannot deny having sent any transaction across the blockchain.
    - Data integrity:
        - Altering data is not possible and would always be detected.
    - Consensus:
        - The nodes' ability to agree on a single value of the network and verify the validity of all the transactions.
- Why is consensus a hard problem?
    - Synchronization do to things like network delay.
    - Malicious nodes trying to disrupt
- Bitcoin
    - The first application and the most successful and popular application of the blockchain technology
    - Sataoshi Nakamoto authored the bitcoin white paper
        - Designed and deployed bitcoins original reference implementation
        - Statoshi nakamoto is just the name used by the pseudoanonymous person or group of people who developed bitcoin
    - virutal currency stored as transactions in the bitcoin blockchain
        - can be bought and sole anonymously
        - price is determined by the market in which it trades
        - very volatile
    - many other blockchains crypto currency like ehteruem
- Smart contracts
    - a smart contract is a computer program executed in a secure environment that directly controls digital assets.
    - a set of conditions recored in a blockchain triggering automated, self-executing code when the predefined conditions are met
    - basically a program stored in the blockchain
    - examples:
        - insurance claim payout
        - crowd-funding pledge
        - games, lotteries, gambling
- Current blockchain limitations
    - Despite blockchains strengths and remarkable properties, there are issues:
        - Scalability
        - Speed
        - Platform integration and devops
        - not really ready for the general public (many people should just use a database.)
        - anonymous transactions
## What is a blockchain? 
    A blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses decentrilzation and consensus mechanisms to create trust amongst untrusted parties. 

## Blockchain: How does it work? 
    The actual structure of a blockchain is that of "blocks" that use a hash function to hash the block and all of its data. There is a genesis block at the start of the blockchain and all future blocks contain the hash of the previous block in the chain. Blocks are "mined" by discovering the value of a nonce. The nonce is a number that causes some number of bits at the start of the hash to be a predetermined number of 0's.

## Blockchain Fundamentals:
    - Transaction’s authorization
    Transactions are authorized by a decentralized consensus amongst miners. When a minerdiscovers a    nonce that hashes the block, it is broadcasted and confirmed by other miners.
    - Block mining
    Blocks are mined by finding a nonce that gives a correct hash for a given block.
    - What can go into a Blockchain?
    Any data can be put onto a blockchain, but usually a list of transactions are what are putinto a    block.
    - How are blocks added to chain?
    Blocks are added to chain when consensus agrees that the block is valid. Other factors likewhich    chain wins out are also necessary. The longest chain wins.

## Blockchain security properties
    - Immutability
    Databases often use the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) princcipal. Blockchains on the other hand only allow for Create, Read. Blockchains are immutable in the sense that no data can be removed from them.
    - Non-repudiation
    This is important principal of blockchain. Once a block is on chain it shows proof that a sender and recipient made a transaction. It would be bad if the either the sender claimed they never sent the money, or the recipient claimed they never recieved money. Blockchain alleviates this by putting transactions on the blockchain.
    - Data integrity
    Integrity in the security world means that the data is what it says it is without be tampered with. Because a blockchain is immutable, and cannot be changed without breaking the blockchain in some, it is ensured that a blockchain's data has integrity.
    - Consensus
    A method used to ensure the agreement that data is valid, that the chain can be trusted, and that the data is secure from attack.
    - Why is consensus a hard problem?
    Their are copious attacks that could be leveraged to compromise the integrity of the blockchain, trust, and security.
