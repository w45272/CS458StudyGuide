# Blockchain Overview – [2 - 3 questions]

## Notes
- A blockchain provides coordination between many parties when there is no single trusted party.
- If trusted party exists there is no need for a blockcahin
- Blockchains can be used in other areas as well like digital asst management.
- Ledgers record all business activity as transactions
- Every market and network defines a ledger
- Ledger records assest transfers between participants
- Problems with traditional ledgers:
    - Too many ledgers
    - Errors in data recording
    - Diverging Ledgers
    - Centralized control - Single point of failure
- Decnetralized distributed ledger records all business activity as transactions
- Shared and replicated in multiple sites
- Controlled by multiple untrusted participants
- Records are added only after reaching consensus
- Problems with blockchain:
    - Double spending 
    - Denial of Service
    - Forking
- A blockchain is a distributed data strucutre that takes the form of an immutable, append-only ledger, maintained by a network of peers rather than a central authority, and that uses cryptography and consensus to ensure consistency.
- Dissimilar to a database that uses "CRUD" Principle
    - Create
    - Read
    - <span style="color:red">Update</span>
    - <span style="color:red">Delete</span>
- Blockchain has only"
    - Create
    - Read
- Records are permanent
- Immutability: Blockchain entries are difficult to alter once they are included in a block. It has has to be achieved by replication.
- Blockcahin: A distributed ledger
    - Eliminates need for central clear house or arbiter
    - Instead, there are multiple mutually distrusting arbiters
    - Multiple copies of distributed ledger can help against ransomware.
- Why is blockchain exciting?
    - Digital currencies that are accessible to anyone connected toi hte internet
    - Decentralized applications
    - Writing decentralized programs
    - Can revolutionize more than just currency
- How does it work?
    - Information is stored in blocks. Each block includes a timestamp, a link to a previous block, and is crypto locked with a hash to prove the contents have not changed.
- Blockchain fundamentals:
    - Add new transactions and organize them into blocks
    - Cryptographically verify each transaction in the block.
    - Append the new block to the end of the existing immutable blockchain
- Proving you authorized to enter a transaction
    - Step 1: to be a participant
        - you must have cryptographic key pairs.
    - Step 2:
        Digitally sign the data
    - Step 3: Block miners finally add and lock the new block
        - Each block verifies the integrity of all blocks in front of it
        - Miner: a computer that creates blocks of transactions and adds blocks. the process is called mining.
- What can go into a blockchain?
    - Transactions
        - virtual currency, securities
        - property transfers
    - Data
        - Intellectual property, songs, poems, art
        - documents
    - Smart Contracts -- executable code
- How are blocks added to the chain?
    - A user signs their list of tranactions
    - A miner then finds a vlaue that makes the hash work
    - After this the new block is broadcast
    - Other miners verify the block and add it to their chain if valid
    - Majoirty of miners need to validate
- Blockchain security properties:
    - Immutability:
        - Blockchain entries are difficult to alter once they are included in a block.
    - Non-repudiation:
        - Entities cannot deny having sent any transaction across the blockchain.
    - Data integrity:
        - Altering data is not possible and would always be detected.
    - Consensus:
        - The nodes' ability to agree on a single value of the network and verify the validity of all the transactions.
- Why is consensus a hard problem?
    - Synchronization do to things like network delay.
    - Malicious nodes trying to disrupt
- Bitcoin
    - The first application and the most successful and popular application of the blockchain technology
    - Sataoshi Nakamoto authored the bitcoin white paper
        - Designed and deployed bitcoins original reference implementation
        - Statoshi nakamoto is just the name used by the pseudoanonymous person or group of people who developed bitcoin
    - virutal currency stored as transactions in the bitcoin blockchain
        - can be bought and sole anonymously
        - price is determined by the market in which it trades
        - very volatile
    - many other blockchains crypto currency like ehteruem
- Smart contracts
    - a smart contract is a computer program executed in a secure environment that directly controls digital assets.
    - a set of conditions recored in a blockchain triggering automated, self-executing code when the predefined conditions are met
    - basically a program stored in the blockchain
    - examples:
        - insurance claim payout
        - crowd-funding pledge
        - games, lotteries, gambling
- Current blockchain limitations
    - Despite blockchains strengths and remarkable properties, there are issues:
        - Scalability
        - Speed
        - Platform integration and devops
        - not really ready for the general public (many people should just use a database.)
        - anonymous transactions
## What is a blockchain? 
    A blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses decentrilzation and consensus mechanisms to create trust amongst untrusted parties. 

## Blockchain: How does it work? 
    The actual structure of a blockchain is that of "blocks" that use a hash function to hash the block and all of its data. There is a genesis block at the start of the blockchain and all future blocks contain the hash of the previous block in the chain. Blocks are "mined" by discovering the value of a nonce. The nonce is a number that causes some number of bits at the start of the hash to be a predetermined number of 0's.

## Blockchain Fundamentals:
    - Transaction’s authorization
    Transactions are authorized by a decentralized consensus amongst miners. When a minerdiscovers a    nonce that hashes the block, it is broadcasted and confirmed by other miners.
    - Block mining
    Blocks are mined by finding a nonce that gives a correct hash for a given block.
    - What can go into a Blockchain?
    Any data can be put onto a blockchain, but usually a list of transactions are what are putinto a    block.
    - How are blocks added to chain?
    Blocks are added to chain when consensus agrees that the block is valid. Other factors likewhich    chain wins out are also necessary. The longest chain wins.

## Blockchain security properties
    - Immutability
    Databases often use the Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) princcipal. Blockchains on the other hand only allow for Create, Read. Blockchains are immutable in the sense that no data can be removed from them.
    - Non-repudiation
    This is important principal of blockchain. Once a block is on chain it shows proof that a sender and recipient made a transaction. It would be bad if the either the sender claimed they never sent the money, or the recipient claimed they never recieved money. Blockchain alleviates this by putting transactions on the blockchain.
    - Data integrity
    Integrity in the security world means that the data is what it says it is without be tampered with. Because a blockchain is immutable, and cannot be changed without breaking the blockchain in some, it is ensured that a blockchain's data has integrity.
    - Consensus
    A method used to ensure the agreement that data is valid, that the chain can be trusted, and that the data is secure from attack.
    - Why is consensus a hard problem?
    Their are copious attacks that could be leveraged to compromise the integrity of the blockchain, trust, and security.

## Blockchain Limitations: Scalability, Speed, Platform Integration & DevOps"
    Problems with things like scalibility and speed come from how a blockchain is secured. It is really important that a blockchain does not allow things like fast transactions as this could lead to a lot of attacks.

## Cryptographic Tools used in Blockchains – [2 - 3 questions]
## Notes
- Public key cryptography
    - symmetric encryption: a single shared key used to both ecnrypt and decrypt
    - asymmetric encryption: use keypairs - a private key and a public key, based on a mathemetical trapdoor function
        - RSA
        - Elliptic Curve
- Proving you are authorized to enter a transaction
    - Step 1: to be a participant
        - you must have cryptographic key pairs
    -Step 2: digitally sign the data
- Public key cryptography
    - addresses are required to make transactions
    - to generate an address in bitcoin
        - choose your private key
        - compute public key then hash it
    - generated keys must satisfy the following
        - it is computationally impossible to derive the private key corresponding to to a given public key
        - it is possible to prove that one knows the private key corresponding to the public key without revealing any information about the private key in the process
- What's wrong with RSA?
    - RSA is based upon the belief that factoring is difficult. This has never been proven
    - Prime numbers are geeting too large
    - Amount of research currently devoted to factoring algorithms
    - Quantum computing will make RSA obsolete overnight
- Public key cryptography
    - Blockchains typically use ECC
    - RSA
        - Keys are LARGE: typically keys today need to be 2048 or 4096 bits to avoid cryptographic analysis (code-breaking)
    - Elliptic curve
        - shorter keys
        - strength
            - the amount of energy to brute force a 228 bit rsa key is equivalent to boiling a teaspoon of water
            - equivalent energy for 228 bit elliptic cruve key would require boiling all the oceans on our planet
- Elliptic Cruve cryptography
    - a trapdoor function based on elliptic cruves, symmetric along the X axis
        - curve with standard form: $$y^2 = x^3 +ax + b \space \space \space a,b \in \real$$ 
        - uses dot product
        - G = starting point
        - Repeat N times (N = Private Key)
        - End coordinates are public key

## Blockchain Implementation – [2 - 3 questions]
- Cryptograhic tool: Hash Function
- A hash function maps a message of an arbitrary length to a m-bit output
    - output known as the fingerprint or the message digest
- How does a hash function work?
    - message is divided into fixed-size blocks and padded
    uses a compression function f, which takes a chaining variable (of size of hash output) and a message block, and outputs the next chaining variable
    - final chaining variable is the hash value
- Well known hash functions are:
    - MD5
        - output 128 bits
        - collision resistance completely broken by researchers
    - SHA1
        - output 160 bits
        - no collision found yet, but method exists to find collisions in less tahn 2^80
    - SHA2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
        - outputs 224, 256, 384, 512 bits respectively
        - no real security concerns yet
- The mining puzzle
    - The proof of work apply to the SHA256 a collision resistant hash function that outputs 32-byte hash values
    - The puzzle: given the hash of previous block find nonce (arbitrary value) such that H(previous block hash) is 32 byte hash with specific number of leading zeroes.

## Bitcoin Mechanics – [2 - 3 questions]
## Notes
- Recap
    - SHA356: a collision resistant has function that outputs 32 byte hash values
    - Digital Signatures
- Overview of Consensus Layer:
    - typically miners are connected to 8-126 other peers (anyone can join)
    - miners broadcast recieved transactions to the P2P network
    - every miner:
        - validates recieved Transactions and stores them in it mempool (unconfirmed transactions)
        - miners see al transactions before they are posted on chain
    - every 10 minutes
        - each miner creates a candidate block from transactions in its mempool
        a "random" miner is selected and broadcasts its block to P2P network
        - all miners validate new block
    - selected miner is paid 6.25 BTC in coinbase Tx (first Tx in the block)
        - only way new BTC is created
        - block reward halves every four years
            - max 21M BTC (currently about 18.75M)
        - miner chooses order of Tx in block
    - Consensus rules exist to this day:
        - 21 million bitcoin to ever be produced
        - target of 10 minute block intervals
        - halving event occurring every 210,000 blocks (aprrox. every 4 years)
        - block reward which starts at 50 and halves continually every halving event until it reaches 0 in about 2140
- Properties 
    - Persistence (immutable):
        - to remove a blokc need to convinve 51% of mining power
    - Liveness:
        - to block a Tx from being posted need to convince 51% of mining power
- Schematic of the blockchain
    - a blockchain is a linked list
    - each block contains two types of structures, a header, and a tranaction list
    - the header contains all metadata regarding a particular block
- Bitcoin blockchain
    - a sequence of block header 80 bytes long
        - time: time miner assembled the block. Self reported
            - block rejected if too far in past or future
        - bits: proof of work difficulty
        - nonce: proof of work solution
        - merkle tree: payer can give a short proof that tx is in the block
        - new block every 10 mins or so
- merkel trees
    - hash of the transactions is a merkle tree (or hash tree) which includes multiple hashes to validate the blocks
- mempool 
    - occurs after signing the transaction
    - when the transaction is broadcast, nodes verify it
    - then mempool stores valid but unconfirmed transactions
- The transaction structure:
    - transaction version is a version number specifying the type of this particular transaction to the network
    - a node can determine the set of rules to be used to verify this particular transaction by reading the version number
    - The lock time specifies whether a transaction can be included in the blokchain right away or after some specified time.
    - a transaction output consists of a cryptographic lock and a value
        - outputs are somehow lcoked and the input provides a key to unlock them
        - the value is simply the amout in satoshis that is locked inside the output
    - transaction input consisits of a pointer and an unlocking key
        - the pointer points back to a previous transaction outpuit
        - the key is used to unlock the previous output it points to
    - unspent transaction outputs
        - all coins are no the same
        - refer to specific coins when spending
        - coins are consumed; create new ones
        - a coin can only be spent once
- UTXO
    - a utxo is nothing more than locked up bitcoins
    - UTXOs contains the coins and they can hold any amounts
    - the transaction hsitroy graph is a canonical list of all the transactions that were evfer recorded by the network
    - every output can be traced in this way all the way back to the instant where it was first created by a coinbase transaction
- Bitcoin transactions history
    - every time an output is successfully unlocked by an input it is marked inside the blockchain database as spent
    - the outputs at the last transactions are the UTXOs because they have not yet been referred to by a transaction input
    - transaction fees
- The UTXO set
    - the collection of all the UTXOs at any moment is called the UTXO set and is being constantly maintained by every botcoin node
    - technically they are known as the chainstate and are stored in the chainstate data directory of a node
    - the chainstate updates itself every time a new block is accepted in the blockchain
    - that block contains the list of latest transactions which defines which of the previous UTXOs are spent and which new UTXOs are created
    - Every bitcoin node in the network will always have the exact same copy of UTXO set in their local storage
    - When you query a wallet for your bitcoin balance, the wallet in the backend gathers up all the UTXOs that you own, and show you the sum of the value of these UTXOs
- The UTXO model
    - in a transaction, UTXOS are always consumed in full even if the required payment is of the partial value of the original UTXO.
    - every UTXO is associated with a botcoin address and there are many types of addresses
    - different addresses provide different functionality for these UTXOs
    - For example if one creates a multisignature UTXO, i.e a UTXO that needs keys from 2 or more people to be spent it is associated with and adress that starts with a 3
- Conclusion
    - UTXOs are locked up box full of coins
    - The lock can be opened by providing the right key
    - When spending some botcoin the wallet creates a transaction that consumes old UTXOs and creates new UTXOs
    - UTXOs are always consumed as a whole and change UTXO is created automatically by the wallet to get back the balance
    - Every UTXO is assoicated with and address. Different types of adresses denote different types of UTXOs.

## Blockchain Consensuses – [3 - 4 questions]
## Notes
- Consensuses and Failures
    - crash failures
    - byzantine failures
- Blockcahin Forks
    - a fork in the chain
- Double spending
    - alice can create two transactions spending the same UTXO!
        - one sneds money to bob the other sends the UTXO to herself
        - only the first transaction should go through
        - there needs to be a global consensus on the ordering of transactions
        - concretely there needs to be an agreement which block extends the blockchain (fork choice problem)
- The 51% attack
    - the blockchain protocol is a form of governance. WE trust the mechanism not necessarily the people
        - blockchain governs a ledger of data
        - We no longer need a 3rd party to do this (bank or government)
        - decentralized
    - protocol is based on democracy: consensus
        - the majority of miners get to decide which version of a blockchain represents the truth
    - Step 1: Stealth mining: a corrupt miner creats an offspring of blockchain by not broadcasting the solution; just keeps adding blocks
        - There are now 2 versions of the blockchain
    - Step 2: the corrupt miner wants to double spend, so buys a lamborghini with his legitimate bitcoin
    - Step 3: off to the races - with more compute power, the corrupt miner can create a longer chain then publish it
    - Step 4: Corrupt miner now has his/her coins back and can spend them again
- The 51% attack: How possible is it?
    - Bitcoin: hard to beat the computational power of thousands of nodes across the network, very unlikely
    - verge: found a bug that allowed faster mining. successful attack
    - typically tried on smaller blockchains
    - ASIC mining: more power to do hashes
- Consensus
    - everyone accpets valid transactions as they come around without "discussion"
        - how do we ensure no one is cheating if we make decisions alone
    - gloria promises 10 BTC to Rustie in one transaction and she promises 10 BTC to nadir in another -- but she only has 10 BTC total
        gloria is performing a double spending attack
    - instead of siloed decisions lets have proposers and voters
        - the proposer submits a transaction to everyone else
        - peers cast votes
        - only save after recieving a certain number of votes
        - now when gloria attempts to double spend she will be rejected by observing peers
        - peers vote no on glorias proposal as they notice multiple transactions trying to spend the same funds
    - keep in mind bitcoin is an anonymous service with no central registry
        - inexpensive to create multiple identities -> multiple oppurtunities to cast votes
        - gloria can perform a sybil attack which will allow her to double spend
        - instead of casting votes with identitieis we cast votes with resources
        - this is called proof of work
    - need to solve a problem via brute force
        - libe brute forcing a password -- trial and error
- Key takeaways on consensus:
    - consensus: the network agrees on a single version of histroy (or transaction record/blockchain) through proof-of-work
        - proof of work makes participation in the consensus process expensive, preventing malcicious entities from tampering with transaction history
        - allows the network to reach consensus without relying on a central authority
- Byzantine generals problem
    - wathced video on it
- Byzantine faults
    - a byzantine fault is any fault presenting different symptoms to different obersvers. A byzantine failure is the loss of a system service due to a byzantine fault in systems that requrie consensus
    - it is a condtion of a computer system, particualryl distributed computing systems where components may fail and ther is imperfect information on whether a component has fialed. Actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system faile, but some of the actors are unreliable or mnalicious
- Distributed systems 
    - distributed systems remove the need for trust with potentially unreliable or malicious parties or if one of the nodes crashes and is unavailable
    - instead we trust a protocol capable of withstanding failure
- CAP theorem for distributed systems
    - CAP is Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
        - you can pick two but not all three
- Distributed Systems
    - byzantine nodes may act maliciously or arbitrarily
    - achieiving consensus when 1/3 or more of the nodes are byzantine nodes is impossible/ not guranteed
- Trustless consensus
    - why does proof of work acutally work?
        - bitcoin network comes to a common agreement (consensus) on the present data state of the ldeger and be able to trust unknown peers. There is an agreement on the miner who gets the reward is the one who solves the puzzle. Proof of work adds artificial computational difficulty to the ledger
- Are there other methods bsides POW?
    - Multiple forms of Nakamoto Consensus:
        - proof of work
        - proof of stake
        - proof of elapsed time
        - proof of capacity/space
        - BFT-RAFT
- Blochchain types and consensuses
    - public/permissionless blockchain
        - anyone is allowed to read, write, and commit, where nodes are neither trusted or known, and membership is not required.
    - private permissioned blockchain
        - limits the right to read to the trusted nodes (members) while the right to write and commit is controlled by the network admin only
    - hybrid blockchain
        - public permissioned blockcahin where any node in the network has the right to read, but the right to write is only for the trusted nodes (members) and commit is limited to a subset of trusted nodes (members)
        - a consortium blockchain limits the right to read in the public permissioned blockchain to the trusted nodes (members)
- Are there other methods besides PoW?
    - multiple forms of consensus (permissionless blockchain):
        - proof of work (bitcoin and ethereum)
        - proof of stake (ethereum)
    - consensus where the miners are trusted (permissioned blockchain):
        - proof of elapsed time (hyperledger sawtooth)
        - BFT-Raft (tangaroa)
        - LWM (Scrybe)
